# laravel-admin
A complete stand up of Laravel 5.1 CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) with admin panel based on AdminLTE front end framework built on Bootstrap 3.5.x.  This great with working with database driven applications and website. This is as lean as possible using the proper Larevel Methods, Views, and Controllers based routing. This project is being built on a local Vagrant VM flavor named Homestead which instruction on setting up can be found on Laravel's website. Setting up a Vagrant Dev env is highly recommended and super easy to do. This project will also use SASS and/or LESS preprocessors to generate the CSS. It may or may not use GULP.  It will use BOWER and COMPOSER. If you like Code Inighter  you will LOVE LARAVEL.
